# BranchBase

BranchBase is an open-source, macOS-first local development control plane for
Git worktrees. It keeps each worktree's apps, ports, processes, logs, and Codex
tasks in one place, so parallel work does not turn into a collection of
terminals and forgotten conversations.

Use it when you regularly create worktrees, run several copies of the same app,
or have multiple Codex tasks working in the same repository.

## What it gives you

- One dashboard for every worktree in a repository.
- Independently startable app groups, such as product apps and local
  infrastructure.
- Stable Friendly URLs, collision-free backing ports, listener detection,
  process ownership, and managed logs. App groups can be isolated per worktree
  or use explicitly selected named instances.
- Command review and trust before repository setup or lifecycle commands run.
- Every non-archived Codex task associated with each exact worktree path.
- Direct **Open task** and **New task** links into the Codex desktop app.
- Optional live Codex activity and automatic BranchBase context through the
  bundled plugin.

The core model is:

```text
repository
  -> worktrees
       -> app groups
            -> apps, ports, processes, and logs
       -> associated Codex tasks
```

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Core BranchBase: macOS, Git, [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3 or newer, and `lsof`
  (included with macOS).
- Codex task discovery: a compatible Codex CLI or ChatGPT desktop app bundle.
- **Open task** and **New task**: ChatGPT desktop, which handles `codex://`
  links.
- Live status and automatic context: the bundled BranchBase plugin installed in
  Codex, with its hooks trusted.

Codex is optional, and the integration does not require an OpenAI API key.

### Run the current integration from `main`

The Codex integration is currently available from `main`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FranciscoMoretti/BranchBase.git
cd BranchBase
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun scripts/daemon.ts start --repo /path/to/your/repository
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:3999>. BranchBase will inspect the repository's worktrees
and ask you to review any repository commands before trusting them.

Use these commands to manage the source-run daemon:

```sh
bun scripts/daemon.ts status
bun scripts/daemon.ts stop
```

BranchBase has not yet been published to npm. Use the source installation above
until the first package release is available.

## Codex integration

BranchBase matches Codex tasks to worktrees using the task's exact canonical
working directory. It exposes every matching non-archived top-level task; the
UI may emphasize the newest one, but the backend does not discard the others.

### Task discovery and desktop links

No plugin is required for the basic integration:

1. Start BranchBase for a repository.
2. Open that repository in the dashboard.
3. Select a worktree to see all of its associated Codex tasks.
4. Use **Open task** to continue an existing conversation or **New task** to
   open Codex at that worktree's path.

BranchBase starts a private `codex app-server` process and decodes only task
names, IDs, timestamps, Git metadata, and exact working directories. Although a
task-list response can contain a preview, BranchBase does not retain, project, or
expose it, and it never requests full turns or transcripts with `thread/read`.
If task discovery is unavailable, the rest of BranchBase continues to work; the
**New task** link is still rendered and works when ChatGPT desktop is installed.

### Optional live status and automatic context

Install the bundled BranchBase plugin to add **Working**, **Waiting for
approval**, **Ready**, and **Unknown** activity plus automatic BranchBase context:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add FranciscoMoretti/BranchBase --ref main
codex plugin add branchbase@branchbase
```

Then restart the ChatGPT desktop app, keep the BranchBase daemon running, and
open or resume a Codex task at a worktree whose root contains a valid
`.branchbase.json`. Review and trust the BranchBase plugin hooks when Codex asks.

The context uses an explicit allowlist: canonical worktree path, branch, app and
group labels, ports, URLs, and process/readiness state. This helps Codex use the
correct running app instead of starting a competing server. Managed logs,
environment values, repository command definitions, prompts, transcripts, and
tool arguments or results are omitted. Hooks are fail-open: if BranchBase is
stopped or the plugin is disabled, Codex continues normally and live activity
eventually becomes Unknown.

See the official [Codex plugin](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/plugins) and
[hook](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks) documentation for the underlying
installation and trust model.

## Discover projects without configuration

Use **Add project → Development folder** to watch a folder containing Git
repositories, or choose **Single project** to add one repository. BranchBase
includes linked worktrees even when their checkouts live outside that folder.
No `.branchbase.json` is needed for observation.

On macOS, observed projects show associated TCP listeners, process start times,
and sampled CPU and memory. Verified HTTP listeners have Open links; other
listeners have copyable addresses. Processes are associated by working directory
and Git root. BranchBase does not infer app groups, claim who launched a process,
retrieve an external process's logs, or take control of it.

Development-folder scans run every 30 seconds while the dashboard is active;
**Development folders → Scan now** refreshes them immediately. Scans go three
levels deep, skip hidden and dependency directories and symlinks, and stop
traversing once a repository is found. Each folder scan is limited to 2,000
visited directories and 100 repositories; up to 20 development folders can be
watched. Removing a folder keeps discovered projects. Removing a project
suppresses its rediscovery until it is explicitly added again.

**Configure app groups** creates a reviewed starter configuration. Command
approval remains a separate step before Start or Setup can execute anything.

## Repository configuration

Commit `.branchbase.json` at the repository root. The setup command prepares one
worktree; each app group can then be started and stopped independently.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FranciscoMoretti/BranchBase/main/schema/branchbase.schema.json",
  "version": 1,
  "setup": { "argv": ["bun", "install"] },
  "appGroups": {
    "Product Apps": {
      "instances": { "mode": "per-worktree" },
      "start": { "argv": ["bun", "run", "dev:branchbase"] },
      "stop": "process",
      "env": {
        "WEB_PORT": "{apps.Web.port}",
        "API_PORT": "{apps.API.port}",
        "API_URL": "{apps.API.url}"
      },
      "apps": {
        "Web": { "protocol": "http", "readiness": "tcp" },
        "API": {
          "protocol": "http",
          "readiness": { "type": "http", "path": "/health" }
        }
      }
    },
    "Local Infrastructure": {
      "category": "infrastructure",
      "instances": { "mode": "selectable" },
      "start": { "argv": ["docker", "compose", "up", "-d"] },
      "stop": { "argv": ["docker", "compose", "down"] },
      "env": {
        "PGHOST": "{apps.Postgres.host}",
        "PGPORT": "{apps.Postgres.port}"
      },
      "apps": {
        "Postgres": { "protocol": "tcp", "readiness": "tcp" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Important configuration behavior:

- The Primary worktree's `.branchbase.json` is the Project default. Every
  worktree inherits it unless **This worktree** is selected as its Configuration
  source in App-group details → Configuration.
- A worktree-specific selection reads `.branchbase.json` from that worktree, so
  a branch can test different commands or App groups without changing its
  siblings. If the selected file is missing or invalid, BranchBase visibly falls
  back to the Project default while preserving the worktree-specific preference.
- Commands are argv arrays and run from the selected worktree root.
- With `"stop": "process"`, Start must remain in the foreground. BranchBase owns
  that process and terminates it on Stop.
- A command-based Stop is useful for detached infrastructure such as Docker
  Compose.
- Set `"category": "infrastructure"` on an App group to include its instances in
  the Infrastructure tab. The default is `"application"`; names do not determine
  category. Shared instances appear once, with their selecting worktrees.
- App groups default to `"instances": { "mode": "per-worktree" }`, which gives
  every worktree its own stable endpoints without any slot or port setup.
- `"mode": "selectable"` creates a shared Default instance and lets each
  worktree select or create named alternatives—for example, an isolated Docker
  Compose database for a migration experiment.
- BranchBase assigns each instance collision-free loopback backing ports and
  keeps them stable across Stop and Restart.
- HTTP Apps receive stable `*.localhost` Friendly URLs through Portless. TCP
  Apps expose their assigned host and port to command templates.
- App-group environment values can be literals or templates such as
  `{apps.Web.port}`, `{apps.Web.directUrl}`, and `{apps.Web.url}`. A group may
  reference another selected instance's host, port, direct URL, or Friendly URL
  with tokens such as `{appGroups.Local Infrastructure.apps.Postgres.port}`.

For a repository without configuration, BranchBase can prepare a starter file
based on common runtime markers. Undetected commands are clearly labeled and
require editing for the project. Creating the file does not approve commands;
you review and trust the resulting fingerprint before anything runs.

### Repository tooling API

Bun scripts can reuse BranchBase's checked-in configuration contract:

```ts
import {
  findBranchBaseConfig,
  loadBranchBaseConfig,
  resolveStartCommand,
  type ResolvedBranchBaseAppGroups,
  type BranchBaseConfig,
} from "branchbase/config";
```

The public API exposes configuration schemas and types, discovery/loading, and
command resolution against an active run's endpoint values. Endpoint allocation,
Portless routing, process ownership, command execution, trust, and controller
internals remain private.

## Architecture

Maintained decisions and compatibility notes live in:

- [ADR 0001: Portless runtime](docs/adr/0001-portless-runtime.md)
- [ADR 0002: Repository schema and local state](docs/adr/0002-repository-schema-and-local-state.md)
- [ADR 0003: Adopt the BranchBase namespace](docs/adr/0003-branchbase-namespace.md)

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
bun run lint
bun run test:types
bun run test
bun run test:integration
bun run build
```

`bun run dev` uses an isolated development session for the current BranchBase
checkout. It chooses collision-free dashboard and Portless ports, prints the
dashboard URL, and keeps its state, trust decisions, managed-process records,
logs, routes, and Codex hook capability separate from the production daemon
under `~/.branchbase/development/`. An installed or source-run daemon may remain
running while BranchBase is developed.

Only one development server may own a checkout's session at a time. Different
BranchBase checkouts receive different sessions and can run concurrently.
Before development starts an app group, it checks the production BranchBase
state and refuses to run the repository Start command if production still has a
verified process or listener for the same worktree. This guard is read-only and
only affects BranchBase development.

Stopping the foreground development server releases its ownership lease and
stops only its own Portless proxy. Codex task discovery remains available, but
the isolated development hook capability does not replace a running production
daemon's capability.

`BRANCHBASE_PORT` and `BRANCHBASE_PORTLESS_PORT` may be used when a fixed
development port is required. They are not needed for normal development.

Git, configuration, port inspection, process ownership, and command rules stay
behind `WorkspaceController` and its internal modules.
